## Note

- Knowing all build systems is not essential.
- Questions on build systems are not usually asked in interviews.
- Knowledge on a single build system is required and can be useful to learn the others based on the project requirements.
- To own a project, you need to know the business part and the tech part of the project.
- Gradle comes under the tech part.
