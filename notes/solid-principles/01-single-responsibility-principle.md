# Single Responsibility Principle

- As per SRP, the class should have one, and only one reason to change.
- It not only applies to a class but also to a method/function and modules.
- The "responsibility" in SRP is the reason to change the code, not neccessarily perform a single task.
- A class can perform multiple related actions as long as they all serve one clear purpose.
- If two methods change for completely different reasons (e.g., business rule vs. display rule), SRP is broken.

## How to detect if this principle is being violated?

- If there are multiple reasons to change the code, it means that the SRP was not kept in mind when writing the code.

## Example of a bad code

```java
public class Employee {

    private int id;

    // Constructor
    public Employee(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Getter
    public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    // Member functions
    public String fetchBioData() {
        return "Some bio data";
    }

    public double calculateSalary() {
        return 0;
    }

    public void printPerformanceData() {
        System.out.println("Performance data...");
    }
}
```

- This class violates SRP as there are multiple reasons to change the file.
- Following are the reasons:

1. Introducing new properties in the class will result in adding more getters and setters. This in fact will result in major code changes.
2. The logic of method `calculateSalary()` can change over time based on the change in the tax regime. This will result in code changes.
3. Assume that currently `printPerformanceData()` prints the data in pdf format. Later we might require to print it in an excel or csv format. This will result in code change.

- This will reduce the re-usability of the current Employee class and make it very complex.
- We want to avoid making unneccessary changes and updation to this particular class.
- Unit tests will be too complex as there are lot of things happening in just one particular class.
- So sharing of responsibility makes it harder to maintain.

## Improving the Employee class

```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;

    public Employee(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return this.id;
    }
}
```

- Now the `Employee` class is only responsible for employee entity management.
- For another functionalities, we can have separate classes as follows:

```java
public class EmployeeSalaryCalculator {
    public double calculateSalary(Employee employee) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

- Only reason to change the `EmployeeSalaryCalculator` class is when the logic to calculate the salary changes.

```java
public class FetchEmployeeBioData {
    public void fetchData(Employee employee) {
        // Returns the data.
    }
}
```

- Only reason to change the `FetchEmployeeBioData` class is when the format of the data needs to be changed.

```java
public class EmployeePerformanceEvaluator {
    public void evaluatePerformance(Employee employee) {
        // Some logic to evaluate the performance
    }
}
```

- The only reason to change the `EmployeePerformanceEvaluator` class is when the logic to evaluate the performance changes.

## Signs of SRP being violated

1. The class name is vague. (`Manager`, `Helper`, `Processor`)
2. You can't summarize what the class does in one short sentence without using `and`.
3. It depends on too many external modules (high coupling).
4. Different developers or teams needs to modify it for different purposes.

## Benefits of SRP

1. It ensures high cohesion (each class focuses on one thing).
2. It reduces coupling (classes donâ€™t depend on multiple, unrelated reasons to change).
3. It also makes it easier to follow other SOLID principles like OCP and DIP.
